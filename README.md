## About 

I hacked this together in a number of hours one day. This is probably my 5th or 6th attempt at building my own mini roguelike engine, and I finally succeeded. 

This is not even a remotely enjoyable game yet!

And yet I had fun hacking it together.

Would not be hard to add a second dimension.

Change the mechanics to suit your wishes.

I think I may use this later to transition from a hack and slash to a walking game with generative conversations with characters the player comes across.

Can also be modified to work in vertical orientation instead of horizontally, not too difficult.

Suffice it to say: LOTS OF BUGS!

#### Things to add:
- [ ] stairs
- [ ] potions (teleport? kill a random enemy? spawn a random enemy?)
- [ ] scrolls? or maybe that's too much
- [X] scrolling! 
- [ ] persistence
- [ ] better core mechanics
