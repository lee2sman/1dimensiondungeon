# Roadmap

## To implement
- [O] potions 
  - [X] teleport
  - [X] get sick ('You were poisoned' and decrease player hp)
  - [ ] cloak of darkness - cannot see actual board, they are renderes as empty spaces - would need clock feature
  - [X] spawn a random enemy
  - [X] agitate monsters (increase their aggression)
  - [X] dissolving spell. fall through floor
- [ ] monsters have specific attack ranges set when monster is spawned rather than random attack points (xp?) each time it hits. This will allow that 'oh no!' feeling to occur when the player sees a particularly nasty enemy rather than have fighting outcome feel more randomized.

## Added
- [X] stairs
- [X] scrolling!  (note: currently eliminated when concept of stairs was added. see earlier git tag 'dungeon-scrolling' for previous sample code)

## Under consideration
- [ ] scrolls? or maybe that's too much
- [X] better core mechanics
- [ ] add varied terrain? locked doors with keys on other side of level?
- [ ] varied enemy behaviors including attacks, 'hallucination' (like toads in Brogue) - would need clock feature, generating minions, freezing, etc
  - [ ] simple clock timeout feature
- [X] choose different font, use color (background and on font)
- [ ] game also output graphically - tiles and/or also runs on web

### Further iterations

I think I may later use this as a basis of creating a walking game with generative conversations with characters the player comes across instead of or in addition to the hack and slash approach...
